## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
- The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS
- Vite
- React JS

### What I learned

- When you import a `.json` file into React it will automatically be parsed ðŸ¥³

- Used a button elements for the time frame options. The user needs to be able to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly states. For accesibiltiy they should be able to do this with a mouse and a keyboard.
- Since I used buttons I could not keep the time frame switching in the same event handler
  `// This wont work with each time frame being a button`

  ```
  const handleTimeFrameChange = (e) => {
  setTimeFrame(e.target.value);
  console.log(timeFrame);
  };
  ```

- Have not been able to get `filter()` to work `data`. This is an array of objects with nested objects. I can get pull out specific information by saving each object in data as a variable.

  ```
  const work = data[0];
  <h2>{work.title}</h2>
  ```

- Not sure the best approach for handling the larger data set that is `data`. Would it be alright to pull each object out into a variable named for it's category and then just handle data separatly? Or should you always keep the data source as the primary place to get data from?
